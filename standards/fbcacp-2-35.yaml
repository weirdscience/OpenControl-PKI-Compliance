  name: Repositories
  description: | 
    The FPKIMA shall operate repositories to support FBCA operations. Entity PKIs are responsible 
    for operation of repositories to support their PKI operations. Entities who cross-certify 
    with the FBCA shall ensure interoperability with the FBCA repository.
Pub-2-1-1:
  family: Pub
  name: FBCA Repository Obligations
  description: |
    The FPKIMA may use a variety of mechanisms for posting information into a repository as required 
    by this CP. These mechanisms at a minimum shall include X.500 Directory Server System that is 
    optionally accessible through the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, Availability of the 
    information as required by the certificate information posting and retrieval stipulations of 
    this CP, and Access control and communication mechanisms when needed to protect repository 
    information as described in later sections. (Practice Note - The X.500 Directory Server System 
    supporting LDAP will remain available until such time as the FPKIMA has determined that the 
    Federal PKI community no longer requires Directory System Protocol (DSP)).

  name: Publication of Certificates and Certificate Status
  description: | 
    CA and End Entity certificates shall only contain valid Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) 
    that are accessible by relying parties. The FPKIMA shall publish all CA certificates issued 
    by or to the FBCA and all CRLs issued by the FBCA in the FBCA repository.  At a minimum, the 
    Entity repositories shall contain all CA certificates issued by or to the Entity PKI and CRLs 
    issued by the Entity PKI. For the FBCA, mechanisms and procedures shall be designed to ensure 
    CA certificates and CRLs are available for retrieval 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with a 
    minimum of 99% availability overall per year and scheduled down-time not to exceed 0.5% annually. 
    Entity CAs being considered for cross certification shall be designed to comply with this 
    requirement.
Pub-2-2-2:

  name: Publication of CA Information
  description: | 
    The FPKIMA shall publish information concerning the FBCA necessary to support its use and operation. 
    The FBCA CP shall be publicly available on the FPKIPA website 
    (see http://www.idmanagement.gov/fpkipa).  The FBCA CPS will not be published; a redacted version 
    of the CPS will be publicly available from the FPKIPA website 
    (see http://www.idmanagement.gov/fpkipa). Publication of CA information in the Entity repositories 
    is a local decision.

  name: Interoperability
  description: | 
    Where certificates and CRLs are published in directories, standards-based schemas for directory 
    objects and attributes are recommended.  Detailed information is available in technical guidance 
    from the FPKIMA; for more information, see the FPKIMA website 
    (see http://www.idmanagement.gov/fpkima).

  name: Access Controls on Repositories
  description: | 
    The FPKIMA and Entity CAs shall protect any repository information not intended for public 
    dissemination or modification. Certificates and certificate status information in the FBCA 
    repository shall be publicly available through the Internet. Direct and/or remote access 
    to information in Entity CA repositories shall be determined by the Entity pursuant to the 
    rules and statutes that apply to that entity. Certificates and certificate status information 
    in the Entity repository should be publicly available through the Internet wherever reasonable. 
    At a minimum, the Entity repositories shall make CA certificates and CRLs issued by the Entity 
    PKI and CA certificates issued to the Entity PKI available to Federal Relying Parties.
