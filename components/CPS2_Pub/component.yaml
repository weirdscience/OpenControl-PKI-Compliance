  - text: >
      Repositories. The FPKIMA operates and uses a variety of mechanisms for posting
      information into a Repository as required by [FBCA CP] and [FCPCA CP]. The use
      of chaining has been deprecated in favor of HTTP directories. The mechanisms
      supported and operated include

      - Maintaining an online X.500 Directory Service System supporting Lightweight
      Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) v3, as directed by the FPKIPA, which allows
      anonymous access and retrieval of the certificate information including all
      cross-certificates issued by and to FPKI Trust Infrastructure CAs, as well as
      the CRLs issued by the FPKI Trust Infrastructure;

      - Maintaining an online web server which allows anonymous access and retrieval
      of certificate information via HTTP, including all cross-certificates issued
      by and to the FPKI Trust Infrastructure CAs and the CRLs issued by the FPKI
      Trust Infrastructure; and

      - Providing administrative access control mechanisms when needed to protect
      FPKI Repository information as described in later sections.
